# Introduction

<!-- Add footer starting from this slide -->
<!--
footer: 'Arista EMEA ANTA Hackathon - 2023'
-->

![bg right:33%](imgs/pexels-suzy-hazelwood-1226398.jpg)

- This hackathon is split into 3 sections. Each section takes around 20 minutes to complete. But it can takes more time if you are running it on your own.
- Work in team, only one submission per team
- Repository is available at [titom73/anta-malaga](https://github.com/titom73/anta-malaga)
- An Arista Test Drive is required. **
- Ask questions at any time!
- Google Chat: [#anta-field](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAN780xDU?cls=7) on Google Chat

> ** There is an alternative cLab setup integrated with this repository and a container with all dependencies (see the last slide for details). Use at your own risk! ATD is the only supported option.

# Context

Your customer told you their servers canâ€™t reach ressources and they configure servers and fabric with LACP

You donâ€™t have access to configuration of devices and you need to identify his issue.

Test your fabric to check:
- If all BGP sessions are UP and established.
- If all interfaces are UP and do not have error or drop counters.
- EVPN family is configured.

# Stage #1

1. Create an ANTA inventory from scratch
2. Create an ANTA test catalog from the test plan
3. Is there any issue on the fabric?

__Thatâ€™s all folks!__

Use your brain and RTFM:
- [Use Inventory & Catalog](https://www.anta.ninja/v0.10.0/usage-inventory-catalog/)
- [ANTA CLI overview](https://www.anta.ninja/v0.10.0/cli/overview/)
- [Get Inventory Information](https://www.anta.ninja/v0.10.0/cli/get-inventory-information/)
- [ANTA Tests catalog](https://www.anta.ninja/v0.10.0/api/tests/)

# Stage #2

Now, you have seen that PortChannel4 is down

Develop a test to check LACP status:

- Check `PortChannel` is in `collecting` mode
- Check `PortChannel` is in `distributing` mode

## Tips

- Use `pip install -e .`
- Develop your tests under `./anta_custom/<your_file>.py`
- Your test will be available with `anta_customer.<your_file>.<your_test>`
- [Test development example](https://github.com/titom73/atd-anta-demo/tree/main/docs)

# Stage #3

Traffic is still not passing correctly. Check that all connected routes are correctly installed in routing table. You should have at least 3 connected routes installed in VRF `Tenant_A_OP_Zone`

Develop a test based on `AntaTemplate` to validate number of connected routes in VRFs:

- Test __must__ use [`anta.models.AntaTemplate`](https://www.anta.ninja/v0.10.0/api/models/#template-definition)
- VRF name is an template input for your test.
- Run ANTA to check routes status and fix configuration in EOS.

# Stage #4

You can now build additional tests to make your customer happier with his Arista Fabric.

__Stage is yours !__

# Conclusion

- How do you think you can use ANTA in the field ?
- What key feature is missing for customerâ€™s usage ?

# ANTA Environment in a Dev Container

- Hackathon repo includes a dev container with AVD, ANTA and Containerlab pre-installed.
- Set ARTOKEN environment variable first to download cEOS image inside the container. Or add it as a bind mount.
- Simply clone the repository in VSCode to start a devcontainer. You'll need Docker Desktop and VSCode Dev Containers extension installed.
- Investigate the environment yourself. It's a hackathon. ðŸ˜„
- This will not work on ARM-base MacBooks, sorry! There is no image to pull. But! You can run the container as Github Codespace.
- Feel free to ask questions, but not for support! Dev Container has a lot of benefits, but ATD is the only supported option.

> BREAKING NEWS: AVD Dev Containers preview is coming soon (you can already pull some). Let's build more demos, hackathons, examples, POCs, workshops, etc. for us and our customers!
